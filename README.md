What requirements did you achieve?
I achieved all the requirements, and all of the user stretch requirements except the back to top button (the buy now button gos to the top anyway, using the # placeholder in the anchor tag) 
and the background music.


Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Apart from the background music, no.

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
The taks I achieved with some difficulty, but with research and looking back on my notes, alongside trial and error I was able to overcome these.

Extra help I used:
A couple of times I used ChatGPT to debug sections of my code if I really couldn't find my error, alongside asking it to explain conepts simply,
for instance when I used inspect element on the spacy website, I didn't understand what the z-index was or why it was used, so I asked chatGPT to 
explain what it meant and simple examples of its use. I also used the notes from the lessons and the demonstartions on Github.

The notes on my HTML and CSS explain my thought process and the research I did for certain sections of code.
